The project is called "My Favorites: the new generation cereals". MyFavorites.com is the website where I place things that I really like and which I suggest viewers try out, such as favorite food, attractions in the city, or movies. 
My main idea was to create an interactive website about Kellogg's cereals and motivate users to buy this product. I was inspired by the notion that even the simplest thing such as the food we eat for breakfast can take place on a special webpage that engages people to learn more about it. 
My motto in implementing this project was “show, not tell,” and I strived to make the website dynamic and not simply provide information about the product. Thus, the website creates a "guide" on how to eat cereals and allows users to have an experience of “eating” the cereals by themselves by suggesting to them the options of choosing the bowl, spoon, types of cereals, etc. (the “create!” tab). Based on their preferences, users can choose different combinations of their favorite cereal bowls: one may choose a pink cereal bowl with milk and another person may choose a grey cereal bowl with yogurt. By giving people freedom of choice and demonstrating the versatility of the product, I hoped to make it more appealing to buy it.
The other thing is that I wanted the website to have a direct conversation with the user by giving them instructions on which buttons to press and how to navigate the website. As an example, the webpage has an embedded video and asks a viewer how this video clip was filmed. As the user follows the page, the answer appears there. In addition, I played with colors on the website and chose bright colors that match the box of the cereals to maintain a similar style. 
Even though my final website contains the features that I planned in the initial design, there are some things that can be improved. I can work on the text font to make it more aesthetic and better fit the style of the product. In addition, I can work on the CSS display to make the webpage size adjust automatically as it shrinks or expands. The main improvement is to learn more difficult functions in javascript to make the website more engaging. For example, when the user chooses his or her preferences of the cereal bowl in the “create!” tab, the image with the final version of all of their choices combined can appear. This element of the game will allow the user to “feel” the product and be motivated to order or buy its physical copy.
